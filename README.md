# Easel
Hey! This is my attempt in creating a programming language!

This was made following the tutorial of [Easel](https://easel.hackclub.com/orpheus-finds-easel)

# How it was made
It was made using JavaScript

# Try it out
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/B-Eddie/easel`
2. Edit test.easel with the easel language
3. Run index.html and watch the easel appear!
